https://github.com/brix/crypto-js/blob/develop/src/sha3.js

// -------------------------------------------------------

to do:

* remove the dependency on web3.js
* add external dependencies:
  - bn.js
  - keccak
      https://github.com/cryptocoinjs/keccak

note:
=====
* both bn.js and keccak were used in the first test
* both work perfectly
